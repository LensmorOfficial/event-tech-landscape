## How to Choose the Right Event Tech

- **By company size**: Enterprise teams often need complex permissions, integrations, and global support. Mid-market teams usually prioritize time-to-launch and pricing flexibility.
- **By budget**: Use a clear split between platform licensing, per-event fees, and add-ons (badging, lead capture, analytics).
- **By role**: Exhibitors focus on lead capture and ROI. Organizers prioritize registration, exhibitor management, and floor plans. Attendees need networking and agenda tools.
- **By integration fit**: Ensure CRM, marketing automation, and data warehouse support before committing.
- **By data quality**: Confirm data ownership, export options, and attribution models.
- **By implementation speed**: Short timelines favor tools with strong onboarding and templates.
